Hi there! Looks like you want to know a bit more about me. So here we
go...

My name is Max, i'm 26 years old and currently working on my bachelor
thesis for a computer science degree. Relatively early in college I
decided to become a software engineer and ever since I've been playing
around with all sorts of tech. I switched from Windows to
[elementaryOS](http://elementary.io) for my daily driver the second I
experienced the power of GNU/Linux and the command line. After that I
started learning all the web related languages on sites like
[codeschool](http://codeschool.com) and
[codecademy](http://codecademy.com). The web fascinates me! I believe
it's the best thing that ever happend to mankind ever since we
discovered fire. It creates a whole new universe of never before
imagined possibilites. It could help us solve some of our most
challenging problems today, but more about this in an other post.

Since I decided to develope for the web I started to read blogs and
books, play with frameworks and tools. This blog's purpose is to
document this journey starting today. I don't expect anybody to read
this, ever. But for those of you who clicked a wrong link and ended up
here, I hope there is something here for you.
